## Configuration tested

## How to apply on PC

Just copy **Engine.ini** to folder **C:\Users\\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Stalker2\Saved\Config\Windows** and replace existing file. Change your settings in game if you need to change them!

You can also replace **GameUserSettings.ini** (but pls make backup of yours file before, it contains games settings which you selected in game: graphics quality, resolution, and other settings etc).

Brief current settings:
 - 2K,
 - FSR Profile: Quality
 - disabled FSR frame generation (more FPS but causes issues in some locations, especially in fight with Faust)
 - high quality of sky and related (Ultra only provides a minor improvement over High)
 - other changes

## FPS

Avg 75-90 FPS in mostly scenes. Very playable with very good graphics quality!
