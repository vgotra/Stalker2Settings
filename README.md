# Stalker 2 Settings

## Configuration tested

Processor: AMD Ryzen 9 7950 X3D 4.20 Ghz (with enabled X3d Gaming)

Video: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT

Memory: 96 Gb (DDR 5, 6000 MT/s overclocked)

Motherboard: MPG X670E Carbon Wifi with latest stable firmware

## How to apply on PC

On Windows copy **Engine.ini** to folder **C:\Users\\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Stalker2\Saved\Config\Windows** and replace an existing file. Change your settings in game if you need to change them!

On Linux you can use **~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1643320/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Stalker2/Saved/Config/Windows/**

You can also copy settings from **GameUserSettings.ini** (but pls make backup of your file before, it contains games settings which you selected in the game: graphics quality, resolution, and other settings etc).

I enabled mostly High and Epic settings. 

To get more FPS, change them.

## FPS

Avg not less than 60 FPS in most scenes (but FSR is disabled, and ResolutionQuality=100). Very playable with very, very good graphics quality!
